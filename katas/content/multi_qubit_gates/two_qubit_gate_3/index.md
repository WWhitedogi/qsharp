**Input:** Two qubits (stored in an array of length 2) in an arbitrary two-qubit state $\alpha |00\rangle + {\color{blue}\beta} |01\rangle + {\color{blue}\gamma} |10\rangle + \delta |11\rangle$.


**Goal:**  Change the two-qubit state to $\alpha |00\rangle + {\color{red}\gamma} |01\rangle + {\color{red}\beta} |10\rangle + \delta |11\rangle$.

> This task can be solved using one intrinsic gate; as an exercise, try to express the solution using several (possibly controlled) Pauli gates.
